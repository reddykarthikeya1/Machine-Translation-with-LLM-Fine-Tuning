##German-to-English Machine Translation Using Fine-Tuned LLMs
**Project Overview**
This project involves building a German-to-English machine translation system using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging the power of pre-trained transformer models, we fine-tuned the **Helsinki-NLP/Opus-MT-de-en** model on the **WMT14 German-English dataset** to achieve a substantial improvement in translation quality.

The primary goal was to create an effective translation model that achieves a BLEU score of at least 20, but our model has astonishingly achieved a **BLEU** score of **30.44**
